> There is a known issue where media disks fail to mount at bootup. This can be manually fixed by running "mount /dev/DISK /jellyfin_media/mediaINDEX", replacing DISK with the disk it said failed to mount, and "mediaINDEX" with the mount point that it states the disk failed to mount on. I am working on fixing this now.
